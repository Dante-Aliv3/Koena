Firefighters must pass both written and physical examinations in order to be considered for employment. Written exams test individuals on their knowledge of basic building codes and layouts, medical procedures and strategies for fighting forest fires. Physical exams test the strength and agility of potential firefighters. Alertness, coordination and self-discipline are all highly necessary for safe and effective firefighting. A continuing commitment to physical fitness is also necessary.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), approximately 91% of firefighters (excluding volunteer firefighters) were employed by local governments in 2012. Employers usually require their firefighters to be certified as emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Most only require the basic level of certification but some larger departments which serve highly crowded metropolitan areas require advanced paramedic training. While high school diplomas were previously the norm for firefighters, some college education and even full college degrees in fire science are increasingly common.*
