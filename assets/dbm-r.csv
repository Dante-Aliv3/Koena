The mobile app development industry is not the kind that requires you to get a specific degree or certification before entering it. While some will come into the field with a bachelor's degree in software development or computer science, it's not always required for landing mobile app development jobs. But just because there are no industry-standard rules for college courses or certifications, that doesn't they aren't impressive to employers. Developers often have a bachelor's degree in a relevant computer science major. Degrees of this type involve concentrations in areas such as data structuring, system design and programming. Learning computer languages is also important. Developers utilize these systems when building the application structure. Many bachelor's degree programs in computer science combine these language classes as a part of the major, while others offer them as electives.*

This is a Career position, an option one should consider when looking for long term job security. This field with the boom of SmartPhone Technology is here to stay, though some job hopping can be expected when looking for quick pay raises. With Mobile App Developers being a relatively new field with less than 20 years since its creation there is still some 'ironing out' to do with pay, formal position status, and expected job contribution. Most mobile developers work in an office setting, remote work and telecommute positions are available however. People in this field work typical hours but can be subject to overtime schedules and long hours on occasions such as when production deadlines need to be met.  *
